# tcl-signal-spec

openSUSE RPM spec for tclsignal

[tclsignal](https://github.com/wjoye/tclsignal) -
Signal extension for Tcl.

Notice:  
When I build this extension and try to load,
I meet library function name issue.
So I add a patch to update the Init function name.

And update version from 1.4 to 1.4.4.
